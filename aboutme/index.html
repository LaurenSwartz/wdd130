    <p>My name is Lauren Swartz and I am from Johannesburg, South Africa. I am married and have 1 son, we do enjoy spending time together and love playing soccer seeing that it is one of son's favourite sports. I have joined the church in 2019 and enjoying every moment of it, learning the gospel and doing the Lord's work. </p>
